function OrganizationPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other organization content */}
      <OrganizationSponsorshipSection 
        organizationId={organizationId}
        organization={organization}
        isAdmin={isAdmin}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

### Organization Sponsorship Settings
Organizations can configure their sponsorship settings in the database:

```javascript
{
  sponsorship: {
    enabled: true,
    description: "Support our mission to create positive change",
    contactEmail: "sponsor@organization.com",
    minimumContribution: 5000,
    allowCustomSponsorship: true
  },
  sponsorshipPackages: [
    {
      name: "Event Sponsorship",
      description: "Support our events and get recognition",
      tiers: [
        { name: "Platinum", minContribution: 50000, benefits: ["..."], maxSponsors: 1 },
        { name: "Gold", minContribution: 25000, benefits: ["..."], maxSponsors: 3 },
        { name: "Silver", minContribution: 10000, benefits: ["..."], maxSponsors: 5 },
        { name: "Community", minContribution: 5000, benefits: ["..."], maxSponsors: 10 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements
